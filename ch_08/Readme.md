# Crates and Modules

In Rust, programs are built using crates, which serve as self-contained units. Each crate comprises all the necessary components for a particular library or executable, encompassing source code, tests, examples, tools, configurations, and other related elements.

A module is a way of organizing code within a crate. Modules allow you to group related code together, control visibility, and manage namespaces.

## Crates

A crate is a compilation unit that produces a library or executable binary.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of crates and their interactions, a practical approach involves using Cargo. By running `cargo build` along with the `--verbose` flag in an existing project that relies on dependencies, you can observe how crates function and interconnect.

This command provides detailed insights into the build process, displaying information about how crates are fetched, compiled, and linked together. The verbosity flag (`--verbose`) offers an in-depth look into the dependencies and their interactions, aiding in the comprehension of how these crates collaborate within the project.

In the context of Rust and Cargo, "dependencies" refer to the other crates or external code that a particular project relies on. These are essentially the crates that our project depends on or uses to fulfill specific functionalities or incorporate certain features.

These crates, serving as dependencies, are typically sourced from crates.io, the Rust community's platform dedicated to open-source crates.

On crates.io, each crate's page displays essential information about the crate. This includes the contents of its README.md file, links to its documentation and source code repositories, and a specific line of configuration that you can copy and add to your project's Cargo.toml file.

The version numbers showcased on these pages represent the latest versions available for the crate at the time of our program's development. These versions serve as references for developers seeking to incorporate these crates into their projects, ensuring they are using the most recent and potentially improved functionalities and fixes offered by these crates.

When you execute `cargo build`, Cargo initiates the process by fetching the source code of the specified crate versions from crates.io. Once obtained, Cargo proceeds by parsing the Cargo.toml files within these crates.

Following this, Cargo identifies and downloads the dependencies declared within these crates' configurations. This process of obtaining dependencies occurs recursively, meaning Cargo continues to delve into each dependency's own specifications, fetching their dependencies as well, creating a cascading chain of downloads until all required components are acquired.

The dependencies that are fetched as a result of this recursive process are termed "transitive dependencies".

The amalgamation of all these interlinked dependency relationships forms a comprehensive structure that informs Cargo about the entirety of necessary crates to build, as well as the precise sequence in which these crates should be constructed. This entire ensemble of interdependent relationships, detailing what crates are required and the hierarchical order in which they must be assembled, constitutes what we refer to as the "dependency graph" of the crate.

For each crate present in the project's dependency graph, Cargo invokes the Rust compiler, rustc.

When compiling libraries, Cargo employs the --crate-type lib option. This directive instructs rustc not to search for a `main()` function but rather to generate an .rlib file. This .rlib file comprises compiled code, specifically designed for utilization in producing binaries or creating additional .rlib files. Essentially, it serves as a library that can be utilized in building other components of the project.

When Cargo engages in compiling a program, it employs the --crate-type bin option. This directive prompts the Rust compiler, rustc, to produce an output that's specifically a binary executable file that can be directly run on the designated platform without any further compilation steps, providing a standalone program ready for execution.

With each rustc command, Cargo includes --extern options, specifying the filenames of the libraries that the crate will utilize. This way, when rustc encounters a line of code like use `image::png::PNGEncoder`, it can identify that image is the name of another crate. Thanks to Cargo's assistance, rustc knows where to locate the compiled crate on the disk.

The Rust compiler necessitates access to these .rlib files because they contain the compiled code of the library. Rust statically links this code into the final executable. Additionally, the .rlib files encompass essential type information, enabling Rust to verify that the features from the library employed in our code indeed exist in the crate and are used correctly. Furthermore, these files contain a snapshot of the crate's public inline functions, generics, and macros. Some features cannot be entirely compiled into machine code until Rust analyzes how we employ them in our code.

One notable option is `cargo build --release`, which generates an optimized build. Release builds execute faster but take longer to compile. They bypass checks for integer overflow, omit `debug_assert!()` assertions, and generally produce less reliable stack traces in case of a panic.

### Editions

Rust takes pride in its robust compatibility guarantees. Code that compiled on Rust 1.0 is assured to compile equally well on Rust 1.50 or any subsequent version like Rust 1.900, if released. However, proposals for significant language extensions sometimes arise, presenting challenges when implementing changes that might render older code incompatible. For instance, adopting a syntax for asynchronous programming with async and await as keywords could break existing code using these identifiers as variable names.

To address this challenge without disrupting existing codebases, Rust introduced the concept of "editions." Each edition of Rust represents a distinct set of language features and rules. The 2015 edition, for instance, maintains compatibility with Rust 1.0. Subsequently, the 2018 edition introduced changes like redefining async and await as keywords, refining the module system, and implementing other language modifications that are incompatible with the 2015 edition.

In the Cargo.toml file's \[package\] section, crates indicate the Rust edition they're written in via a line like `edition = "2018"`. If this line is absent, the 2015 edition is assumed, ensuring backward compatibility. However, to utilize features specific to newer editions, such as asynchronous functions or the updated module system, the `edition = "2018"` (or a more recent edition) declaration in the Cargo.toml file becomes necessary.

Crucially, Rust assures that the compiler accepts all existing editions of the language, allowing programs to seamlessly integrate crates written in different editions. A crate's edition solely influences how its source code is interpreted; once compiled, edition distinctions are irrelevant. This eliminates the necessity of updating old crates solely to engage with the modern Rust ecosystem or forcing a crate to adhere to an older edition to accommodate users. Edition changes are only required when incorporating new language features into your code.

The Rust project doesn't release editions annually; they're introduced when deemed necessary. It's generally recommended to utilize the latest edition, especially for new code, as `cargo new` defaults to creating projects on the latest edition. Additionally, for crates written in older Rust editions, the `cargo fix` command might assist in automatically upgrading the code to a newer edition. The Rust Edition Guide offers comprehensive coverage of edition changes and details the `cargo fix` command.

### Build profiles

Build profiles allow developers to configure and manage different build settings for various scenarios or purposes within their Cargo.toml file. These profiles offer a way to specify distinct configurations tailored to different use cases, such as development, testing, or production.

There are several predefined build profiles:

- **Default Profile**: This profile is utilized when no specific profile is chosen. It generally emphasizes speed and ease of debugging, ideal for day-to-day development work.

- **Release Profile**: The release profile is optimized for producing efficient and optimized code for deployment in production. It typically includes compiler optimizations and excludes debug information to enhance performance.

- **Custom Profiles**: Developers can create additional profiles as needed, allowing them to define unique configurations for specific purposes or environments. For instance, a custom profile optimized for testing might retain certain debugging features without compromising performance significantly.

Here's a table mapping the Cargo.toml configuration settings sections to their respective command line usage:

| Command                 | Cargo.toml Section  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| `cargo build`           | `[profile.dev]`     |
| `cargo build --release` | `[profile.release]` |
| `cargo test`            | `[profile.test]`    |

These commands correspond to specific sections within the Cargo.toml file, enabling developers to specify different settings and configurations for various build scenarios. For instance, `[profile.dev]` is used to define settings for development builds, `[profile.release]` for optimized release builds, and `[profile.test]` for testing configurations.

Typically, default build settings work well for most scenarios. However, there's an exception when using profilers, tools that track where a program spends its CPU time. To gather comprehensive data from a profiler, both optimizations (commonly enabled in release builds) and debug symbols (usually present in debug builds) are necessary. Combining these can be achieved by modifying your Cargo.toml file:

```toml
[profile.release]
debug = true # enable debug symbols in release builds
```

This configuration controls the inclusion of debug symbols (-g option) in the Rust compiler (rustc). With this setup, executing `cargo build --release` results in a binary containing both debug symbols and the optimizations typically associated with release builds. The optimization settings remain unaffected by the addition of debug symbols.

## Modules

Modules are organizational units that help structure code within a crate. They allow developers to group related functionalities, types, and traits together, enhancing code organization and readability. Modules aid in managing code complexity by breaking it into smaller, more manageable parts.

To create a module in Rust, you can use the `mod` keyword:

```rs
mod my_module {
    // module code goes here
}
```

Key aspects of modules include:

1. **Encapsulation:** Modules encapsulate code, acting as a boundary that defines the visibility of items (functions, structs, enums, etc.). Items can be marked as public or private within a module, controlling their accessibility to code outside that module.
2. **Namespace:** Modules provide a namespace, preventing naming collisions by allowing items with the same name to coexist within different modules.
3. **Nesting:** Modules can be nested within each other, allowing for hierarchical organization of code. This nested structure is represented using the `mod` keyword.
4. **File Organization:** Rust follows a convention where module structure often aligns with the file system structure. Each module may reside in its own file or be grouped together in a single file, aiding in code navigation and maintenance.

### Nested modules

Nested modules refer to the ability to organize modules within other modules, creating a hierarchical structure within a crate.

```rs
// Define an outer module named 'math'
mod math {
    // Declare a submodule named 'operations' within the 'math' module
    pub mod operations {
        // Define functions within the 'operations' submodule
        pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
            a + b
        }

        pub fn subtract(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
            a - b
        }
    }

    // Declare another submodule named 'constants' within the 'math' module
    pub mod constants {
        // Define constant values within the 'constants' submodule
        pub const PI: f64 = 3.14159;
        pub const E: f64 = 2.71828;
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Access functions from the 'operations' submodule in the 'math' module
    let result_add = math::operations::add(10, 5);
    let result_subtract = math::operations::subtract(20, 8);

    println!("Addition result: {}", result_add);
    println!("Subtraction result: {}", result_subtract);

    // Access constants from the 'constants' submodule in the 'math' module
    println!("Value of PI: {}", math::constants::PI);
    println!("Value of E: {}", math::constants::E);
}
```

### Visibility

By default, items (functions, structs, etc.) in a module are not visible outside of that module. Rust offers granular control over the visibility of items within modules using different pub modifiers.

- `pub`: Marks an item (function, struct, enum, etc.) as public, allowing it to be accessed from outside its module or crate.

  ```rs
  mod my_module {
      // This function is not visible outside of the module
      fn my_private_function() {}

      // This function is visible outside of the module
      pub fn my_public_function() {}
  }
  ```

- `pub(crate)`: Makes an item visible only within the current crate. It restricts visibility to the current crate but allows access from any module or function within that crate.

  ```rs
  // Define a module named 'my_module' in the same crate
  mod my_module {
      // Define a function accessible within the current crate
      pub(crate) fn internal_function() {
          println!("This function is accessible within the crate");
      }
  }

  fn main() {
      // Access the function from the same crate
      my_module::internal_function();
  }
  ```

- `pub(super)`: Specifies that an item is visible to the parent module only. It restricts visibility to the immediate parent module and hides it from sibling or descendant modules.

  ```rs
  mod parent_module {
      // Define a submodule 'sub_module'
      mod sub_module {
          // Define a function visible only to the parent module
          pub(super) fn restricted_function() {
              println!("This function is accessible to the parent module only");
          }
      }

      // Attempting to access 'restricted_function' from outside 'sub_module' will result in an error
      // sub_module::restricted_function(); // Uncommenting this line will result in a compile-time error
  }
  ```

- `pub(in <path>)`: Sets visibility for an item within a specific module path and its descendants. This form of visibility restricts access to a particular module and its nested modules, allowing the item to be accessed only from that specific path.

  ```rs
  mod my_module {
      // Define a submodule 'nested'
      mod nested {
          // Define a function accessible within the 'my_module' and 'nested' modules
          pub(in crate::my_module::nested) fn specific_function() {
              println!("This function is accessible within 'my_module::nested' and its descendants");
          }
      }

      // Access 'specific_function' from 'my_module' or 'nested' modules
      nested::specific_function();
  }
  ```

### Modules in Separate Files

Modules can be organized across separate files, aligning with the module structure to maintain a clean and manageable codebase. This approach helps in structuring larger projects and facilitates better organization and readability.

Here's an example demonstrating how modules can span multiple files:

Consider a project structure like this:

```less
math_crate/
│
├── Cargo.toml          // Package manifest
└── src/
    ├── main.rs         // Entry point (optional for binaries)
    └── lib.rs          // Entry point for the library crate
    └── math/
        ├── mod.rs      // Module declaration file
        ├── operations.rs // File containing operation functions
        └── constants.rs  // File containing constant values
```

Contents of `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package]
name = "math_crate"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[lib]
name = "math_lib"
path = "src/lib.rs"

[[bin]]
name = "main"
path = "src/main.rs"
```

The `main.rs` file is the entry point of the application, and within the `math` directory, there are three files:

1. `mod.rs`: This file declares the module structure.

   ```rs
   // Declare the module 'math' and its contents
   pub mod operations;
   pub mod constants;
   ```

2. `operations.rs`: This file contains functions related to operations.

   ```rs
   // Define functions within the 'operations' module
   pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
       a + b
   }

   pub fn subtract(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
       a - b
   }
   ```

3. `constants.rs`: This file contains constant values.

   ```rs
   // Define constant values within the 'constants' module
   pub const PI: f64 = 3.14159;
   pub const E: f64 = 2.71828;
   ```

In the `lib.rs` file:

```rs
// Declare the module structure within the crate
pub mod math;
```

In `main.rs`, or any other file within the same crate:

```rs
// Access the 'math' module
use math_crate::math;

fn main() {
    // Use functions and constants from the 'math' module
    println!("Addition result: {}", math::operations::add(10, 5));
    println!("Value of PI: {}", math::constants::PI);
}
```

This structure allows developers to organize code within a module across multiple files, keeping related functionalities segregated for better code management and readability in larger projects. The `mod.rs` file acts as the entry point to declare the module's structure, and other files contain the actual implementations for various components of the module.

### Paths and Imports

#### Paths

- **Absolute Paths**: Start from the crate root using the crate name or from a crate root using `crate`.
- **Relative Paths**: Start from the current module using `self`, `super`, or a module's identifier.

#### Imports

- **Use Declarations**: Bring items (functions, structs, etc.) into scope, reducing the need for long path references.
- **use Keyword**: Enables importing items from a path into the current scope.

The `::` operator (path separator) is used to access features within modules or crates. It's employed to reference specific items, such as functions or constants, within the specified module or crate.

For instance, in the code snippet:

```rs
use std::mem;

if s1 > s2 {
    mem::swap(&mut s1, &mut s2);
}
```

Here, `std::mem` refers to the `mem` module within the `std` crate, and `mem::swap` accesses the `swap` function within the `mem` module.

Importing with the `use` declaration allows creating local aliases for modules or items, making it more convenient to access them within the scope of the block or module where the import is specified.

Additionally, the `use` declaration can import multiple items or modules at once, either by specifying each individually or using the shorthand syntax:

```rs
use std::collections::{HashMap, HashSet};
use std::fs::{self, File};
use std::io::prelude::*;
```

Using `as` with `use` allows importing an item while giving it a different name locally, as demonstrated in:

```rs
use std::io::Result as IOResult;
```

Modules don't inherently inherit names from their parent modules. Instead, each module begins with an empty scope and must explicitly import the names it requires. Paths within a module are by default relative to that module's context.

The keyword `self` is also used as a synonym for the current module. It represents the module itself and allows referencing items within the same module without specifying the full path. This facilitates shorter and more concise references to items within the current module.

```rs
// File: my_module.rs

// Define a submodule named 'sub_module'
mod sub_module {
    pub fn hello() {
        println!("Hello from sub_module!");
    }
}

// The current module
mod current_module {
    // Using `self` to reference the current module
    pub fn greet() {
        println!("Greetings from the current module!");
    }

    // Using relative paths to access items in the same module
    pub fn perform_greeting() {
        self::greet(); // Accessing 'greet' function using `self`
        super::sub_module::hello(); // Accessing 'hello' function from the sibling module
    }
}
```

### The Standard Prelude

The Standard Prelude refers to a set of pre-imported modules and traits that are automatically available in every Rust program without needing explicit imports. This prelude consists of fundamental types, traits, and functions that are frequently used in Rust programming.

The Standard Prelude includes:

1. **Primitive Types**: Such as `bool`, `char`, numeric types like `i32`, `u64`, and others.
2. **Standard Traits**: Traits like `Copy`, `Clone`, `Debug`, `Default`, and `PartialEq` are part of the prelude.
3. **Commonly Used Functions**: Functions like `println!`, `format!`, `panic!`, and `assert!` are also available by default.

By having these items in the prelude, Rust code can directly use these fundamental types, traits, and functions without requiring explicit imports, making the code more concise and readable.

Naming a module prelude is just a convention that tells users it's meant to be imported using `*`.

Developers can also create their own prelude by defining modules and traits that they frequently use across multiple parts of their codebase. This allows them to have a set of common functionalities readily available without repetitive imports.

### Making use Declarations pub

```rs
pub use math::operations::add;
```

By combining `pub` to mark items as public and `use` to import them into a scope, Rust enables developers to organize code effectively and make specific functionalities accessible across various parts of the codebase.

### Making Struct Fields pub

Struct fields are private by default, meaning they can only be accessed within the same module where the struct is defined. However, you can use the `pub` keyword to make specific fields of a struct public, allowing access from outside the module where the struct is declared.

```rs
// Define a struct with private and public fields
pub struct MyStruct {
    // Public field accessible from outside the module
    pub public_field: i32,

    // Private field accessible only within this module
    private_field: f64,
}

impl MyStruct {
    // Constructor function to create instances of MyStruct
    pub fn new(public: i32, private: f64) -> Self {
        Self {
            public_field: public,
            private_field: private,
        }
    }

    // Method accessing private field within the same module
    pub fn get_private_field(&self) -> f64 {
        self.private_field
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Create an instance of MyStruct
    let my_instance = MyStruct::new(10, 3.14);

    // Accessing the public field from outside the module
    println!("Public field value: {}", my_instance.public_field);

    // Error: Cannot access private field outside its module
    // println!("Private field value: {}", my_instance.private_field);

    // Accessing private field using a method from within the module
    println!("Private field value: {}", my_instance.get_private_field());
}
```

### Statics and Constants

Statics and constants are used to declare values that remain unchanged throughout the execution of the program. Both are immutable, meaning their values cannot be modified after they are defined, ensuring consistency and reliability in the codebase.

### Statics

- **`static` Keyword**: Declares a static variable, which has a `'static` lifetime, meaning it lives for the entire duration of the program.
- **Initialized at Runtime**: Static variables can be mutable but require the `mut` keyword. They are initialized at runtime.
- **Access from Anywhere**: Statics can be accessed from any scope within the program.
- **Example**:

  ```rs
  static MY_STATIC_VAR: i32 = 42;
  ```

### Constants

- **`const` Keyword**: Declares a constant variable, which must be annotated with a type and can be set to a value known at compile time.
- **Immutable and Known at Compile Time**: Constants are immutable and their values must be known at compile time.
- **Bound to a Scope**: Constants are bound to a specific scope, meaning they are only accessible within the scope in which they are declared.
- **Example**:

  ```rs
  const PI: f64 = 3.14159;
  ```

## Attributes

Attributes are annotations that provide additional information about various constructs in the code, such as functions, structs, enums, and modules. They are prefixed with `#` and are typically placed just before the item they are affecting.

Attributes serve different purposes, including:

1. **Compiler Instructions**: Attributes can be used to provide instructions or hints to the compiler. For instance, `#[derive(Debug)]` automatically implements the `Debug` trait for a struct or enum, allowing it to be printed using `println!("{:?}", my_struct);`.

   ```rs
   // Deriving the Debug trait for printing the struct
   #[derive(Debug)]
   struct MyStruct {
       value: i32,
   }

   fn main() {
       let instance = MyStruct { value: 42 };
       println!("{:?}", instance); // Using the Debug trait for printing
   }
   ```

2. **Conditional Compilation**: Attributes like `#[cfg]` (configuration) enable or disable certain code blocks based on specific conditions. This is useful for platform-specific code or enabling features conditionally.

   ```rs
   // Code block only compiled for the 'debug' configuration
   #[cfg(debug_assertions)]
   fn debug_function() {
       println!("Debug mode is active!");
   }

   fn main() {
       debug_function(); // This function will only be compiled if debug_assertions is true
   }
   ```

   Here's the commonly used options within the `#[cfg(...)]` attribute in Rust:

   | #\[cfg(...)\] option        | Enabled when...                                                                                                                                                                                            |
   | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | test                        | Tests are enabled (compiling with `cargo test` or `rustc --test`).                                                                                                                                         |
   | debug_assertions            | Debug assertions are enabled (typically in non-optimized builds).                                                                                                                                          |
   | unix                        | Compiling for Unix, including macOS.                                                                                                                                                                       |
   | windows                     | Compiling for Windows.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

   | target_arch = "x86_64"      | Targeting x86-64 in particular. Other values: "x86", "arm", "aarch64", "powerpc", "powerpc64", "mips".                                                                                                     |
   | target_os = "macos"         | Compiling for macOS. Other values: "windows", "ios", "android", "linux", "freebsd", "openbsd", "netbsd", "dragonfly".                                                                                      |
   | feature = "robots"          | The user-defined feature named "robots" is enabled (compiling with `cargo build --feature robots` or `rustc --cfg feature='"robots"'`). Features are declared in the `[features]` section of `Cargo.toml`. |
   | not(A)                      | A is not satisfied. To provide two different implementations of a function, mark one with `#[cfg(X)]` and the other with `#[cfg(not(X))]`.                                                                 |
   | all(A,B)                    | Both A and B are satisfied (equivalent of `&&`).                                                                                                                                                           |
   | any(A,B)                    | Either A or B is satisfied (equivalent of `                                                                                                                                                                |

   Here's a breakdown of them:

   - **`test`**: Enabled when compiling with `cargo test` or `rustc --test`, indicating that tests are enabled.
   - **`debug_assertions`**: Enabled in non-optimized builds, typically activating debug assertions.
   - **`unix`**: Active when compiling for Unix-based systems, including macOS.
   - **`windows`**: Active when compiling for Windows-based systems.
   - **`target_pointer_width = "64"`**: Enabled when targeting a 64-bit platform; `"32"` for 32-bit platforms.
   - **`target_arch = "x86_64"`**: Active when targeting the x86-64 architecture. Other options include `"x86"`, `"arm"`, `"aarch64"`, `"powerpc"`, `"powerpc64"`, and `"mips"`.
   - **`target_os = "macos"`**: Active when compiling for macOS. Other options include `"windows"`, `"ios"`, `"android"`, `"linux"`, `"freebsd"`, `"openbsd"`, `"netbsd"`, and `"dragonfly"`.
   - **`feature = "robots"`**: Enabled when the user-defined feature named `"robots"` is activated, such as with `cargo build --feature robots` or `rustc --cfg feature='"robots"'`. Features are declared in the `[features]` section of `Cargo.toml`.
   - **`not(A)`**: Inactive when condition `A` is satisfied. Useful for providing different implementations based on the absence of a condition.
   - **`all(A,B)`**: Active when both conditions `A` and `B` are satisfied (equivalent to `&&`).
   - **`any(A,B)`**: Active when either condition `A` or `B` is satisfied (equivalent to `||`).

   These options allow conditional compilation in Rust, enabling developers to write code that behaves differently depending on the target platform, features, or compilation conditions.

3. **Documentation**: Rust uses `#[doc]` to generate documentation for items like functions, structs, and modules. This helps in generating documentation using tools like Rustdoc.

   ```rs
   // Generating documentation for a function
   #[doc = "Adds two numbers together"]
   fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
       a + b
   }

   fn main() {
       let result = add(5, 7);
       println!("Result: {}", result);
   }
   ```

4. **Control over Warnings**: Attributes like `#[allow]` or `#[deny]` control compiler warnings or errors for specific pieces of code. For example, `#[allow(unused_variables)]` suppresses warnings about unused variables.

   ```rs
   // Suppressing the warning for unused variables
   #[allow(unused_variables)]
   fn unused_var_function() {
       let x = 5; // This variable is unused but won't generate a warning
   }

   fn main() {
       unused_var_function();
   }
   ```

### `#[inline]`

The `#[inline]` attribute is used to suggest the compiler to consider inlining a function at its call sites. Inlining is a compiler optimization where the code of the called function is inserted directly into the calling function, avoiding the overhead of a function call.

When a function is marked with `#[inline]`, it's a hint to the compiler that the function is a good candidate for inlining. However, the compiler ultimately decides whether to honor this suggestion based on various factors such as function size, complexity, and optimization settings.

This attribute can improve performance in certain cases by reducing the function call overhead. However, excessive use of `#[inline]` can potentially increase the code size and compilation time.

Example:

```rs
#[inline]
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

fn main() {
    let result = add(5, 7); // The 'add' function may be inlined at this call site
    println!("Result: {}", result);
}
```

In this example, the `add` function is marked with `#[inline]`, suggesting to the compiler that it can be inlined where it's called. The compiler may decide to honor this suggestion based on its optimizations.

There's a scenario where inlining might not occur unless specified with `#[inline]`. When a function or method defined in one crate is invoked from another crate, Rust won't inline it by default unless it's generic (having type parameters) or explicitly marked with `#[inline]`. Otherwise, the compiler considers `#[inline]` as a suggestion rather than a strict directive.

Rust offers more specific attributes to control inlining behavior:

- **`#[inline(always)]`**: This requests the function to be expanded inline at every call site, prioritizing inlining aggressively. It's a stronger directive than `#[inline]`.
- **`#[inline(never)]`**: This specifies that a function should never be inlined, even if the compiler might otherwise choose to inline it.

These attributes provide developers with more control over inlining behavior in Rust code, ensuring functions are handled according to their intended usage and performance needs.

#### Function Call Overhead

The overhead of a function call refers to the additional computational cost incurred when invoking a function in a program. This overhead includes several elements:

1. **Stack Operations**: The function call requires the allocation of memory on the stack for local variables, function arguments, and the return address.
2. **Argument Passing**: Arguments passed to the function often involve copying or passing references to data, which can introduce additional computational cost.
3. **Context Switching**: When a function is called, the program's execution context transitions to the function, and upon return, it reverts to the original context. This context switching introduces some overhead.
4. **Branching Overhead**: Control flow moves from the current point in the code to the function, then returns. This transition involves branch prediction and instruction pipelining, which may incur some overhead.
5. **Return Handling**: After the function execution, the return value needs to be handled and delivered back to the calling code, which adds to the overall cost.
6. **Cache and Pipeline Effects**: Function calls might disrupt CPU caching and instruction pipeline efficiency, leading to additional overhead due to cache misses or pipeline stalls.

Minimizing function call overhead is often crucial for optimizing code performance, especially in performance-sensitive applications. Techniques like inlining, where the function code is directly substituted into the calling code, aim to reduce this overhead by eliminating some of these costs associated with function invocation.

## Tests and documentation

Tests and documentation are crucial aspects of software development:

### Tests

- **Ensure Code Reliability**: Tests verify that the code behaves as intended, detecting errors or bugs.
- **Prevent Regressions**: By creating test cases, developers can prevent unintended changes from breaking existing functionalities.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automated tests integrated into CI pipelines validate code changes, ensuring they meet quality standards before merging.
- **Rust's Testing Framework**: Rust provides a built-in testing framework with attributes like `#[test]` to designate test functions and the `cargo test` command to execute tests. Test functions assert expected behavior using `assert!`, `assert_eq!`, or `assert_ne!`.

### Documentation

- **Code Clarity**: Documentation clarifies the purpose, usage, and behavior of functions, modules, and types, aiding developers in understanding code.
- **Rustdoc**: Rustdoc, the documentation tool in Rust, generates documentation from specially formatted comments (doc comments) using `///` or `//!`. It creates HTML documentation from these comments.
- **Crate Documentation**: Documentation is essential for crates published on crates.io. It helps users understand how to use the crate's functionalities.
- **Comments vs. Documentation**: Comments explain code internally, while documentation serves as externally visible documentation generated by tools like Rustdoc.

````rs
/// # Example
///
/// This function `add` takes two integers `a` and `b` and returns their sum.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `a` - An integer value
/// * `b` - An integer value
///
/// # Returns
///
/// An integer representing the sum of `a` and `b`
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// let result = add(3, 5);
/// assert_eq!(result, 8);
/// ```
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_add() {
        // Test case to validate the add function
        assert_eq!(add(3, 5), 8);
        assert_eq!(add(-2, 7), 5);
        assert_eq!(add(0, 0), 0);
    }
}
````

**Explanations**:

- The function `add` is documented using Rust's doc comments (`///`). It describes the function's purpose, arguments, return type, and provides an example of usage.
- The `add` function takes two integers `a` and `b` and returns their sum.
- A test module `tests` is defined using `#[cfg(test)]`, indicating that it contains tests.
- Inside the `tests` module, the `test_add` function tests the `add` function using assertions (`assert_eq!`) to ensure expected behavior.

The test harness leverages multiple threads to concurrently execute multiple tests, leveraging Rust's default thread-safe behavior. To modify this behavior:

#### Running Single Tests

- To run a specific test, use `cargo test testname`.
- To limit test execution to a single thread, run `cargo test -- --test-threads 1`. The double dashes (`--`) ensure that the `--test-threads` option is passed through to the test executable.

#### Displaying Output

- By default, the test harness only displays output from failing tests.
- To show output from both passing and failing tests, use `cargo test -- --no-capture`.

These options enable developers to customize test execution behavior. Running specific tests or controlling the display of output can be beneficial for debugging or examining test results in detail.

### Doc-Tests

Doc-tests in Rust serve the dual purpose of documenting code and verifying its correctness through embedded tests within documentation comments.

#### How Doc-Tests Work

- **Documentation Comments**: Rust allows the use of `///` and `//!` comments to document code elements like functions, modules, and types.
- **Embedded Examples**: Within these comments, examples of code usage can be included, demonstrating how functions or modules are intended to be used.
- **Automatic Testing**: Rust's documentation tool, Rustdoc, extracts these examples and executes them as tests during the documentation build process.
- **Assertions**: Doc-tests commonly employ assertions (`assert!`, `assert_eq!`, etc.) to validate expected outcomes.

````rs
/// Adds two numbers together
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let result = add(2, 3);
/// assert_eq!(result, 5);
/// ```
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
````

- When running `cargo test` or `cargo doc`, Rustdoc automatically identifies and runs the embedded code examples within documentation comments.
- It executes these examples as tests and validates their expected outcomes.
- This process ensures that the documented code examples are correct and remain up-to-date as the codebase evolves.

#### Syntax to Hide Lines

- To exclude a line from being displayed in the documentation, prefix it with `#` (hash followed by a space) at the beginning of that line.
- This hides the line from the generated documentation but ensures its inclusion for compilation purposes.

````rs
/// Function to demonstrate addition
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// # use my_crate::add;
/// let result = add(2, 3);
/// assert_eq!(result, 5);
/// ```
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
````

In Rust's documentation, when displaying a complete program including a `main` function, Rustdoc won't automatically add any additional code or functions to it. This is because code blocks containing the exact string `fn main` are considered complete programs by Rustdoc.

````rs
/// Demonstrates a complete program with a main function
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// fn main() {
///     println!("Hello, world!");
/// }
/// ```
fn main() {
    println!("This is the main function.");
}
````

#### Disabling Test Execution

- To compile an example but prevent Rust from executing it during testing, use a fenced code block with the `no_run` annotation.
- This annotation indicates to Rustdoc that the code should compile but should not be executed during the testing process.

````rs
/// Demonstrates a code snippet that should not be executed during testing
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// fn main() {
///     // This code is for demonstration and shouldn't be executed during testing
///     println!("This won't be executed during tests.");
/// }
/// ```
fn main() {
    println!("This is the main function.");
}
````

This feature allows displaying full program samples in documentation without automatically executing them during the testing phase.

#### The `ignore` annotation

Functionality:

- **Compile Expectation**: `ignore` indicates that the code block isn't expected to compile or run successfully.
- **Testing Behavior**: Unlike `no_run`, blocks marked with `ignore` don't appear in the output of `cargo run`.
- **Test Outcomes**: In test reports, code blocks labeled with `ignore` won't show as passed tests, even if they compile successfully.

Non-Rust Code or Plain Text:

- For code blocks that contain non-Rust code or plain text, use the name of the relevant language (e.g., `c++`, `sh`) or `text` to denote plain text.
- Rustdoc doesn't recognize all programming language names. An annotation it doesn't recognize signifies that the code block isn't Rust code.
- This disables syntax highlighting and doc-tests for that specific block.

````rs
/// Demonstrates an invalid code block with ignore annotation
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```ignore
/// // This is not Rust code and won't be tested or compiled
/// function myFunction() {
///     console.log("This won't compile in Rust.");
/// }
/// ```
fn main() {
    println!("This is the main function.");
}
````

In this example, the `ignore` annotation is used to label a block of code that isn't Rust code and won't be compiled or tested. Additionally, using language names other than Rust (e.g., `c++`, `sh`) or `text` indicates that the block contains code in another language or plain text, respectively. This helps Rustdoc understand that the enclosed code isn't intended for Rust compilation or testing.

## Specifying Dependencies

Specifying dependencies in Rust is typically done using Cargo, Rust's package manager. Here's how it's done:

### Cargo.toml

- **Dependencies Section**: In the `Cargo.toml` file, there's a section named `[dependencies]`.
- **Package Listing**: Inside `[dependencies]`, you specify the packages (crates) your project relies on along with their versions.

### Syntax

```toml
[dependencies]
crate_name = "version"
```

- **`crate_name`**: Replace this with the name of the crate you want to depend on.
- **`version`**: Specify the version of the crate you want to use.
  - Versions can be specified in different ways:
    - Exact version: `"1.2.3"`
    - Version range: `"^1.2.0"` (means any version compatible with `1.2.0` but not above `2.0.0`)
    - Features or git paths for crates not published on crates.io.

```toml
[dependencies]
rand = "0.8.5"
serde = { version = "1.0.193", features = ["derive"] }
reqwest = { version = "0.11.23", features = ["json"] }
crate_name = { path = "crates/my_crate" }
```

In this example:

- `rand` crate is specified at version `0.8.5`.
- `serde` crate is at version `1.0.193` and includes the `"derive"` feature.
- `reqwest` crate is at version `0.11.23` and uses the `"json"` feature.
- `crate_name` is the name used within the project for the local crate and `path` points to the directory `my_crate` inside the `crates` directory of the project.

Cargo fetches these dependencies when the project is built, ensuring the required crates are available for compilation and usage within the project.
