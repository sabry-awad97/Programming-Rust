# References

References in Rust are denoted with an `&` symbol and are used to borrow data from a source, rather than taking ownership of the data. This means that when a reference goes out of scope, it does not cause the data it refers to to be deallocated.

References are a way to allow multiple parts of your code to read or write to a single piece of data without requiring ownership of that data. This can be useful in many situations, such as when you want to pass a large piece of data to a function without copying it, or when you want to allow multiple parts of your code to access a single resource.

Here is an example of using a reference:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let len = calculate_length(&s);
    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

In this example, the `calculate_length` function takes a reference to a `String` as its argument. This reference is denoted with the `&` symbol. The function does not take ownership of the `String`, so it is still available to be used after the function call.

In this example, the `calculate_length` function takes a reference to a `String` as its argument. This reference is denoted with the `&` symbol. The function does not take ownership of the `String`, so it is still available to be used after the function call.

It is also possible to use references to mutate the data they refer to. This is done by using a mutable reference, which is denoted with the `&mut` symbol. Here is an example of using a mutable reference:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    change(&mut s);
}

fn change(s: &mut String) {
    s.push_str(", world!");
}
```

In this example, the `change` function takes a mutable reference to a `String` as its argument. This mutable reference is denoted with the `&mut` symbol. The function is able to modify the value of the `String` through the reference.
